# Breast Cancer Prediction App

## Overview
This project is a web application that predicts whether breast cancer is **malignant** or **benign** using machine learning. The app is built using Python and Streamlit for the user interface.

## Project Highlights
- **Technology Used:** Python, Streamlit for the UI, and Scikit-learn for machine learning.
- **Model:** The model is trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset and helps classify tumors as either malignant or benign.
- **User Interface:** The app allows users to input various features (e.g., mean radius, mean texture, etc.) and get predictions in real-time with a simple and clean UI.

## Live Demo
You can try the app live here: [Breast Cancer Prediction App](https://predict-breast-cancer-jrhence4vstxbsb4wxqtm4.streamlit.app/)

## Features
- Real-time prediction of breast cancer classification
- Easy-to-use interface for inputting features
- Displays predictions and probabilities instantly
